# Project Name
> Lending companies, lending loans to ‘risky’ applicants is the largest source of financial loss (called credit loss). Credit loss is the amount of money lost by the lender when the borrower refuses to pay or runs away with the money owed. In other words, borrowers who default cause the largest amount of loss to the lenders. In this case, the customers labelled as 'charged-off' are the 'defaulters'.

> Company wants to understand the driving factors (or driver variables) behind loan default, i.e. the variables which are strong indicators of default.

> We are here, using historic loan data to determine the factors contributing to the Charged off for deciding future applicant’s risk for Charge off

## Conclusions
- Small Business seem to have highest risk of Charge off
- Higher the revolving credit more change of Charge Off
- Grade/SubGrade has higher impact with Charge off Loans, but most of the loans are for higher grade customers with low charge off
- The more the percent of Revolving Credit used the risk for charge off
- Increase in interest rate have adverse impact on Loan Status
- Most of the Small Business Loans have higher interest rates
